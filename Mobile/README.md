lib/
├── models/         # Data classes (using Freezed)
├── services/       # API handlers, Firebase, etc.
├── views/          # UI screens
├── providers/      # App state
├── widgets/        # Reusable UI components
└── main.dart       # App entry

## 🔒 Authentication
- Firebase Email/Password Auth
- Token-based API auth with refresh logic
- Role-based access to admin/user routes

## 📎 Notes
- Ensure your HERE Maps account has routing and geocoding enabled.
- Some APIs require CORS configuration on the backend.
- Flood alert logic uses geolocation (make sure user grants permission).
