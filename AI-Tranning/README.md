# Flood Detection AI Module

## 📦 AI Module – Safe-Move Flood Detection

This module contains the AI component of the Safe-Move system, responsible for detecting floods in real-time from images captured by over **600 traffic surveillance cameras** throughout **Ho Chi Minh City**. It uses advanced deep learning techniques, including **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **Transfer Learning**, and a custom synthetic dataset generated to simulate flood conditions.

## 🔍 1. Model Architecture

### 1.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are used to extract features from surveillance images, identifying flood-related visual patterns like water presence, submerged structures, etc.

- **Convolutional Layers**: Learn image edges, textures.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify flood vs. non-flood.

### 1.2 Transfer Learning

Pretrained models on ImageNet are fine-tuned for flood detection. This boosts accuracy while saving training time.

### 1.3 Data Augmentation

- Techniques: Rotation, zoom, brightness, flipping
- Purpose: Improve model generalization, reduce overfitting

### 1.4 Image Preprocessing

- Resize, grayscale conversion, normalization, cropping
- Ensures input consistency and highlights flood features

### 1.5 Optimizer

- Used: **Adam** optimizer
- Adapts learning rate, stabilizes convergence

### 1.6 Loss Function

- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Measures prediction error

### 1.7 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Intersection over Union (IoU)

### Abstract Summary

Due to the difficulty and danger of capturing real flood images, we synthesized a large-scale dataset using:

- **ClimateGAN**: Converts normal traffic images to flood-like conditions
- **SAM (Segment Anything Model)**: Extracts vehicle masks for realistic cut-paste
- **Color Blending**: Harmonizes inserted vehicles with flood backgrounds

Used YOLOv10 for evaluation, reaching **mAP = 28.8**, showing realistic complexity of generated flood scenes.

## 📊 5. Dataset

A total of **7411 synthesized flood images** were generated using:

- VisDrone as base normal dataset
- ClimateGAN for simulation
- SAM for segmentation and cut-paste
